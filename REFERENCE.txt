[VERSE 1]

I'VE TRIED SO HARD TO SEE IT
TOOK ME SO LONG TO BELIEVE IT
THAT YOU'D CHOOSE SOMEONE LIKE ME
TO CARRY YOUR VICTORY
[VERSE 2]

PERFECTION COULD NEVER EARN IT
YOU GIVE WHAT WE DON'T DESERVE AND
YOU TAKE THE BROKEN THINGS
AND RAISE THEM TO GLORY
[CHORUS 1]

YOU ARE MY CHAMPION
GIANTS FALL WHEN YOU STAND
UNDEFEATED EVERY BATTLE YOU'VE WON
I AM WHO YOU SAY I AM
YOU CROWN ME WITH CONFIDENCE
I AM SEATED IN THE HEAVENLY PLACE
UNDEFEATED WITH THE ONE WHO HAS CONQUERED IT ALL
[VERSE 3]

NOW I CAN FINALLY SEE IT
YOU'RE TEACHING ME HOW TO RECEIVE IT
SO LET ALL THE STRIVING CEASE
THIS IS MY VICTORY
[BRIDGE]

WHEN I LIFT MY VOICE AND SHOUT
EVERY WALL COMES CRASHING DOWN
JESUS HAS GIVEN ME
WHEN I OPEN UP MY MOUTH
MIRACLES START BREAKING OUT
I HAVE THE AUTHORITY
JESUS HAS GIVEN ME
[CHORUS 2]

YOU ARE MY CHAMPION
GIANTS FALL WHEN YOU STAND
UNDEFEATED EVERY BATTLE YOU'VE WON
I AM WHO YOU SAY I AM
YOU CROWN ME WITH CONFIDENCE
I AM SEATED IN THE HEAVENLY PLACE
UNDEFEATED BY THE POWER OF YOUR NAME
I AM SEATED IN THE HEAVENLY PLACE
UNDEFEATED WITH THE ONE WHO HAS CONQUERED IT ALL
