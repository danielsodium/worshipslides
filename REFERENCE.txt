[VERSE]
THESE ARE THE DAYS OF ELIJAH,
DECLARING THE WORD OF THE LORD,
AND THESE ARE THE DAYS OF YOUR SERVANT, MOSES,
RIGHTEOUSNESS BEING RESTORED.
AND THOUGH THESE ARE DAYS OF GREAT TRIALS,
OF FAMINE AND DARKNESS AND SWORD,
STILL, WE ARE THE VOICE IN THE DESERT CRYING,
PREPARE YE THE WAY OF THE LORD!

[CHORUS]
BEHOLD HE COMES, RIDING ON THE CLOUDS,
SHINING LIKE THE SUN AT THE TRUMPET CALL.
SO LIFT YOUR VOICE, IT'S THE YEAR OF JUBILEE,
AND OUT OF ZION'S HILL, SALVATION COMES.

[BRIDGE]
THERE IS NO GOD LIKE JEHOVAH,  THERE IS NO GOD LIKE JEHOVAH,
THERE IS NO GOD LIKE JEHOVAH,  THERE IS NO GOD LIKE JEHOVAH.
THERE IS NO GOD LIKE JEHOVAH,  THERE IS NO GOD LIKE JEHOVAH,
THERE IS NO GOD LIKE JEHOVAH,  THERE IS NO GOD LIKE JEHOVAH.
THERE IS NO GOD LIKE JEHOVAH,  THERE IS NO GOD LIKE JEHOVAH,
THERE IS NO GOD LIKE JEHOVAH,  THERE IS NO GOD LIKE JEHOVAH.
